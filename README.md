### Demo application for Angular Framework


a) Why did you choose the library or framework you chose?
>I chose the Angular framework because I think it's gonna be a industry standard in the near future which is handy skill to have.

b) What did you know about the library or framework when you chose it?
>I didn't know much about the angular framework I never had the chance to work with angularJS and when I read an article about how angular 2 is very different from angularJS I thought I should give it a shot.

c) What are all the resources (web pages, tutorials, videos, etc.) that you used to help you?
> I used official angular framework docs, documentation and tutorial at [angular.io](http://angular.io).

d)What was the most challenging part of the assignment, and how did you overcome it?
> It was working with the npm. I had troubles with the typescript transpiling and starting the lite-server when I type npm start. I had to delete all the npm_modules and re-install it to make it work.

e) After using it, what do you like about the library or framework you chose and why?

>The framework itself is very close to android application development itself which is very handy for me because I'm working part-time as a mobile app developer.

f)What do you dislike about the library or framework you chose and why?
>I haven't see any points to dislike in my simple project but my view can be change if I work on something more complex in the future.
